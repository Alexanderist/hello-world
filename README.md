# hello-world

I am a very language-focused person, a visual learner, and a creative. I think these aspects of myself are a great reason to pursue web design and see what I can come up with. As I mentioned in my introduction in the class, I am a Type 1 Diabetic and also a streamer on Twitch.tv. Recently, I spent a good hour setting up a method to show my active blood glucose on-screen while I am livestreaming, by following a few lengthy and (to me) technical guides. To be honest, I don't remember what I did through these guides, nor do I understand them on a technical level. I handled github, a diabetes management app called sugarmate, and a cloud service to handle my glucose information, with virtually no understanding. One of my goals in learning web design is understanding how these (and more) aspects of web tech function and communicate with one another, and feel comfortable with implementing them myself. Then I will be able to see how I can take this skillset further, as I am extremely interested in diabetes information technology and how it can help myself and other diabetics in real time.
